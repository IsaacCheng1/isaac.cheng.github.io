	Hi! I am Isaac.
	<br>
	<br>
	I regard myself as 90% software engineer and (maybe less than? hmm...)10% researcher. I often times find great enjoyment from one choloate croissant every fri. morning, with one cup of mediocre self-made coffee : )

	I trust in God and God's love, which has always been refreshing and comforting to me. Lord, thank you so much : )

	In my leisure time, I read twitters (I become more and more addicted to twitters, and idk whether this is a good thing for me...).

	I like yummy food (especially from the hole in the wall places, you know...) because it always make me happy. I like NLP(Natural Language Processing) because I just like it.
